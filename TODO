Fields/Column customisation:
 - Option to show/hide fields in the table
 - Option to show additional fields in the HTML Preview
 - Allow customising the fields slurped from the server (e.g. used by plugins)
 - Move to String[] (instead of TreeMap) to store ticket fields. (Memory and speed.)
   (Will have to recreate all tickets whenever new fields are discovered - infrequent.)

Table:
 - Support copying text (e.g. to paste into Excel)
 - Sort Priority & Severity naturally (not alphabetically)
 - Configurable colour coding (e.g. priority, severity, milestone etc...)
 - Tooltips for truncated fields

Search combo:
 - Render typed alias/shorthand words in blue
    - (Override paint to call drawString with a generated AttributedString?)
 - Allow '-' before an alias to negate the alias terms(?)
 - ESC to revert previous text
    - Make extra sure the combo doesn't lose the search text. E.g. after pressing DOWN
      it should select the first item. But then after pressing UP or ESC the focus
      should return to the editor with the original text retained.
 - Allow '|' in field label?
 - Consider GlazedLists? (Can it integrates with all the customisations?)

Authentication
 - Stop 'Connect' dialog showing when network connection interrupted. (Very annoying.)
 - Offer to save site password

Download panel:
 - Search "additional attachments" folders recursively
 - Show size of file & percentage downloaded

Tools:
 - Find in Tickets: Merge bottom 2 panels, with various view-modes
 - Add Inconsistent keyword detector
 - Add Score field/column; with a configuration dialog to build up scoring formulas

Data sources:
 - Outlook import into user fields (e.g. categories, flag 'notes')
 - Allow user columns which derive from other columns via 'capturing regular expressions'
    - e.g. to extract a "[Topic]" word from the start of a Summary field

BUGS:
 - The "Find Tickets in Text" tool window doesn't update unless the description panel
    changes. I.e. particularly when no table-row is selected, even changing the search
    and updating the table does not update the "Find Tickets in Text" results
 - When saving a search containing an alias, should expand the alias in the saved result.

Code Tidying:
 - Switch to Gradle?
     - Introduce Guava (Immutable collections!)?
     - Proguard (to strip out unused library code?)
 - Create new 'TicketLoader' to more-cleanly manage the 4 loading-tasks, and their cancelling.
 - PropertyChangeListener -> TicketLoaderListener? so the loader listens
   on its multiple tasks, and the frame only listens on one object.

UI Polish:
 - Store column ordering & sizing properly. Column sizes currently 'drift' as the
   window is resized or reopened.
 - Store position of all splitters
 - RENAME CONTROLS (and update accelerators): &Search -> &Filter then can use &Star/&Save? (or &Bookmark?)
 - Auto-save preferences while working
